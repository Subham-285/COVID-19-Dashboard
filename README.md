# Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard
Amidst the global turmoil caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for accessible, reliable data became paramount. The COVID-19 Data Exploration and Dashboard project was born out of this necessity, aiming to provide a comprehensive analysis and visualization platform for understanding the pandemic's impact. Leveraging datasets from sources like Our World in Data, the project utilized SQL data exploration techniques to extract insights and develop a Tableau dashboard. By offering stakeholders a user-friendly interface to explore key metrics such as confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccinations, the project aimed to empower informed decision-making and foster dialogue on public health strategies and socio-economic impacts.

# Project Overview
This document serves as documentation for the COVID-19 data exploration and dashboard project, which aimed to analyze and visualize COVID-19-related data from the Our World in Data repository. The project involved SQL data exploration, table creation, data cleaning, and the development of a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau.

## Tools and Technologies:
The project utilized the following tools and technologies:

SQL (Structured Query Language): The primary language used for data manipulation, exploration, and analysis.
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): For database creation, data parsing, and initial data exploration.
Tableau: For creating a variety of visualizations and interactive dashboards based on SQL query findings.
Excel: While not directly used in the project, the dataset obtained from 'Our World in Data' was in Excel format, serving as the initial file type for data exploration.
This combination of tools facilitated a comprehensive approach to the analysis, from database creation and exploration using SQL to visual representation and interactive dashboards in Tableau. The dataset's initial format in Excel underscored the importance of diverse tools in handling and extracting insights from real-world datasets.
